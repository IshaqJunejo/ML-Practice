## Day-09

### Cross Validation

Practiced `Cross-Validation` by implementing `K-Fold Cross Validation` and `Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation` on a `breast-cancer-dataset`.

Implemented the `Cross-Validation` on multiple Machine Learning models,
 - `Logistic Regression`.
 - `Random Forest`
 - `Support Vector Classifier`
 - `Decision Tree`
 - And `K-Nearest Neighbours`.

In both `K-Fold` and `Stratified K-Fold`, `Logistic Regression` performed the best in terms of `Accuracy`, where as `Decision Tree` performed the worst. And `Random Forest` took the longest amount of time to be trained.
